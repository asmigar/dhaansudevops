**About Us**

We had to open this platform because `There is huge shortage of DevOps Professionals. So we are here to teach you devops. We will always be there for you during your devops journey.`

**What are we going to do?**

Practice coding in python -> Start learning shell scripting -> Start learning linux concepts -> Start learning AWS cloud -> Start learning DevOps tools -> Crack interview -> Get work done on the job -> Get paid well -> Rinse and repeat.



**Next Plans?**
